2. Compile code under "src/"
3. Execute

===TWEAKING===
In our Main class, we left some flags (static booleans) on the top to allow some tweaking and experimenting without having to change the code. These flags allow to choose which datasets to use, which algorithms to use, optimizations and other features. By setting the flags to true/false it should be possible to test every aspect of our assignment (including every possible combination of algorithms and features) and see some console output showing the results as they are generated.
